The `aem::osgi::config` resource allows you can create and manage OSGi configurations for an AEM instance. 

**Note**: OSGi Configuration Factories are not supported; Felix does not have a mechanism for correctly defining them via a file, and you cannot assign the Service PID via the console.

#### Examples

* [File Type](osgi-config/File-Type.md)
* [Console Type](osgi-config/Console-Type.md)
